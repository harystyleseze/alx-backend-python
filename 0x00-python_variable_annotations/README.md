## Description
The project provides a series of exercises designed to help developers understand and implement type annotations in Python. It covers basic and complex types, as well as best practices for writing type-safe code.

### Features
- Type-annotated functions for basic operations like addition and concatenation.
- Functions that handle complex types, including lists and tuples.
- Implementations that demonstrate the principles of duck typing.
- Type checking using `mypy` for validation of type annotations.

## Installation
