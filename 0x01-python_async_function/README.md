## Project Overview
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python, leveraging the `asyncio` library to manage concurrency and asynchronous operations. It includes several modules that demonstrate the creation and handling of asynchronous tasks, measuring execution times, and effectively managing multiple coroutines.

### Objectives
- Understand the concepts of asynchronous programming in Python.
- Implement functions that utilize coroutines and tasks.
- Measure execution time of asynchronous operations.
- Gain hands-on experience with the `asyncio` library.

## Directory Structure

    ├── 0-basic_async_syntax.py       # Basic syntax for asynchronous programming.
    ├── 1-concurrent_coroutines.py      # Function to execute multiple coroutines concurrently.
    ├── 2-measure_runtime.py            # Function to measure runtime of asynchronous tasks.
    ├── 3-tasks.py                      # Function to create and return asyncio tasks.
    └── 4-tasks.py                      # Function to execute multiple tasks using task_wait_random.
```

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.7 or higher
- **Libraries**: `asyncio` (included in the Python standard library)

## Installation
To run the scripts, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
You can clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harystyleseze/alx-backend-python.git
cd alx-backend-python/0x01-python_async_function
```

## Usage
Each module contains a specific function or set of functions designed to demonstrate different aspects of asynchronous programming. To execute the test files for each task, follow these steps:

1. **Make the Main Files Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 4-main.py
   ```

2. **Run the Main File**:
   For example, to run the test for `task_wait_n`, execute:
   ```bash
   ./4-main.py
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   The output will be a list of floating-point numbers representing the delays generated by the tasks, sorted in ascending order. For instance:
   ```
   [0.2261658205652346, 1.1942770588220557, 1.8410422186086628, 2.1457353803430523, 4.002505454641153]
   ```

## Features
- **Basic Asynchronous Syntax**: Understanding how `async` and `await` keywords function.
- **Concurrency**: Execute multiple coroutines concurrently and gather their results.
- **Task Management**: Create asyncio tasks and measure their execution times.
- **Sorting Results**: Return results in a sorted order without using built-in sort functions.
