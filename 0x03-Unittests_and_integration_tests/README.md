## Project Overview

This project is part of the ALX backend program, specifically focused on testing practices in Python. It includes:
- Unit tests using the `unittest` framework to validate the functionality of utility functions.
- Mocking HTTP calls to ensure no external requests are made during testing.
- Parameterization of tests to efficiently cover multiple cases with minimal code duplication.
- Integration tests to verify the interactions between different components of the codebase.

### Key Features
- Comprehensive unit testing for utility functions.
- Use of mocking to avoid actual HTTP requests.
- Integration tests that simulate real-world usage of classes.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.7
- **Testing Framework**: unittest
- **Mocking Library**: unittest.mock
- **Parameterization Library**: parameterized

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harystyleseze/alx-backend-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-python/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required packages installed. You can create a virtual environment and install dependencies as needed.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests and integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s . -p "*.py"
```

This command will automatically discover and run all test files in the current directory.
